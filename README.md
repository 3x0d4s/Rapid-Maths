# Rapid-Maths
Hello guys, I'm working on an app called rapid maths similar to a website called Mathletics, where a math equation shows up including a correct of an incorrect answer.  The user must decide if the answer is true or flase, but i've run into a prblem with the Main.storyboard, I can create connected actions or IBOutlets for UILabels and UIButtons.  It says i'm connected to the exit and not the View Controller, if you can fix this can you please download the files and forward it to me. 
Thank you.
